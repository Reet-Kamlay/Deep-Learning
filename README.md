# 🧠 Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of deep learning projects built using **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **PyTorch**. These projects demonstrate the implementation of fundamental and advanced concepts such as image classification, object detection, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and more.

Each project is structured for clarity and includes a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) with code, visualizations, and explanations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Reet-Kamlay/Deep-Learning.git
cd Deep-Learning
```

### 2. Setup Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If provided
```

Or manually install:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python tensorflow keras
```

### 3. Open a Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open any `.ipynb` file and run the cells.

## 📦 Additional Resources

- Model files, datasets, and extra notebooks are available in the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fXGTTgo11p1Mo_7AImC8bfemrZU-BcOh).
- Some notebooks may require you to download additional data (check notebook instructions or Drive).
